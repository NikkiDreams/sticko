## About this theme

I descided on forking this theme because it simple and a clean, modern, **responsive** and a **free** theme for the emerging -and absolutely amazing- blogging platform called [Ghost](http://ghost.org). If you don't know Ghost it is a Node.js blogging application that is very light and even runs well on hosted solutions running cPanel and Softaculous.

I will be updating and adding my own touches to this theme for my own use. But I hope someone eles out there will also find it a great theme to expand on as well.

### Installation

* Grab a copy of this repository.
* Place it inside your Ghost installation folder; specifically in `/content/themes/`.
* Restart your Ghost instance.
* Log in the admin panel, go to `Settings > General` and select **sticko** from the Theme dropdown menu. Then hit **Save**.

**Optional:** Set a cover image for your fresh installed blog. If you dont, dont worry; **sticko** comes with a preset cover image.

### Set a cover image for every post

[Ghost](http://ghost.org) does not let you specify a cover/featured image *yet*, but **sticko** allows that functionality just by specifying the proper alt property of the desired image:


`![cover-image](url)`.

Thanks to [Thomas Cullen](https://github.com/Thomascullen92) for this great workaround.

### Setting navigation links

Open the file `nav.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.

### Setting social media links

Open the file `social-media.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.

### Editing footer

Open the file `footer.hbs` located in `/partials/` folder.

### Editing CSS/SCSS files.

**Sticko** is developed on top of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install), which means that you are going to need both running on your own machine; follow both guides to set up the proper environment.
